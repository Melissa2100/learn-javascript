// Variable
// A variable is a container for storing data
// A variable behaves as if it was the value that it contains

// 2 steps
//1. Declaration (var, let, const)
// 2. Assignment (assignment operator)

//3 data types
let firstName = "Pascal"; //strings
let age = 21; //number
let student = true; //boolean
document.getElementById("p1").innerHTML = "Hello " + firstName;
document.getElementById("p2").innerHTML = "You are " + age + " years old";
